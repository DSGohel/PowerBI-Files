4. Energy Level Indicator: The energy percentage dial gives a quick overview of the overall energy level of the selected tracks or artists.

How it Works:

The dashboard is divided into several sections, each providing a unique perspective on the data:

1. Track Info: This section provides detailed information about a specific track, including the title, artist, release date, and duration. It also includes various musical attributes like acousticness, danceability, energy, liveness, speechiness, and valence.

2. Tracks by Streams: This bar graph shows the popularity of different songs based on stream counts, allowing users to identify the most listened to tracks.

3. Tracks by Release Date: This graph plots song releases over time, with corresponding spikes indicating their popularity. This helps users understand how track release dates impact popularity.

4. Average Streams/Year: This counter displays the average number of streams per year, providing a measure of overall user engagement.

5. Daily Streaming Data: A calendar heatmap shows daily streaming data over months and years, providing visual insights into user’s listening habits across different periods.

6. Energy % Dial: This dial indicates the energy level for selected music, giving users a quick overview of the overall energy level of their music selection.
